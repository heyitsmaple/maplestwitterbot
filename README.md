# random-image-twitterbot

A simple skeleton project for a Twitter bot that tweets random images.

1. Clone/download this repo and install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Rename `config-example.js` to `config.js` and fill out the necessary information ([see how](https://botwiki.org/tutorials/how-to-create-a-twitter-app/)).
3. Put all your images into the `images` folder.
4. [Deploy your bot.](https://botwiki.org/tutorials/bot-hosting) Or [remix it on Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/random-image-twitterbot).

Oh and definitely join [Botmakers](https://botmakers.org/)! 


## Notes

Use `server-delete-images.js` if you'd like to delete each image after posting it. Also, see `server-attribution.js` for an example how to credit the author if you're tweeting someone else's images.
